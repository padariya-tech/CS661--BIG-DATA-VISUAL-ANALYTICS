## Steps to run the code : 
1. Load the code in jupyter notebook.
2. Change the path of the vti file accordingly.
3. Run the code cell by cell.
4. For the final image to appear, on making changes , we need to wait for few seconds after changing the slider or reset button is clicked.(As it depends on the system computational ability).
